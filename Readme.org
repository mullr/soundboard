* A simple remote-controlled soundboard
This is a trivial soundboard program that is controllable via a web
browser, but plays the sounds on the computer where it's running. I
built this to use this in conjunction with discord-audio-pipe for my
online RPG games, controlled from my iPad.

** Installation
Get rust, cargo, etc. Then clone this repo, and:
#+begin_src sh
  cargo install --path .
#+end_src

** Usage
#+begin_src sh
  soundboard -d <directory full of audio files>
             -d <another one, if you like>
#+end_src
